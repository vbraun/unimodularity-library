=== DIFFERENT VERSIONS ===


There are three versions of the library:

 * The default version requires the Boost C++ Libraries 1.43.
 * There is a "noboost" version. Since all the necessary
   Boost headers are incorporated the static library is not
   built. Hence, only the binaries can be used.
 * There is a third version "polymake" which is an extension
   for the Polymake system.



=== INSTALLING ===

To compile the default or noboost version of the TU test, just type:

./configure
make

If you like to install the headers and the library, type:

make install

If you only want to use the executable, you can copy it from src/unimodularity-test.



=== INSTALLING THE POLYMAKE EXTENSION ===

From the Polymake shell, simply type:

import_extension ("/unpacked/directory/");
